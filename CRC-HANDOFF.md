# CRC Development Handoff — Context for New AI Assistants

**Last updated:** 2026-03-02
**Purpose:** This document supplements `CLAUDE.md` (in the repo root) with lessons learned from active development sessions. Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then this document.

> **Note on the `runners` table:** The `runners` table was dropped from Supabase in Mar 2026. All runner data comes from `profiles`. The TypeScript `Runner` interface and function names like `getRunners()` are kept as domain-level abstractions — they describe what the data represents (a runner), not which table it lives in.

---

## 1. Critical Rule: Never Guess Schemas

The single most important lesson from development so far:

> **Never assume database column names, table structures, or API shapes. Always ask the user for the actual schema before writing queries.**

Guessing has caused multiple failed deploys. The user will happily run a SQL query and share the results. It takes 30 seconds and prevents hours of debugging.

To get a table's columns:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

To get RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'your_table_name';
```

---

## 2. Database Schema (Current — Feb 2026)

### Recent Migration (Feb 24, 2026)
Tables were renamed and consolidated:
- `runner_profiles` → **`profiles`** (the canonical user data table)
- `achievements` → **`game_achievements`**
- `ticket_messages` → **`support_messages`**
- `profile_audit_log` → **`audit_profile_log`**
- **`moderators`** → DROPPED (replaced by role tables + `profiles.is_admin`)
- New: **`role_game_moderators`**, **`role_game_verifiers`** (role assignment tables)

### `profiles` (approved profiles — single source of truth)
| Column | Type | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| id | uuid | PK |
| user_id | uuid | FK to auth.users |
| runner_id | text | Unique slug, e.g. "gary-asher" |
| display_name | text | |
| pronouns | text | |
| location | text | |
| bio | text | |
| avatar_url | text | |
| socials | jsonb | `{ twitch, youtube, twitter, bluesky, instagram, other[] }` |
| games | ARRAY | |
| featured_runs | jsonb | |
| badges | jsonb | |
| is_public | boolean | |
| is_admin | boolean | **Admin flag** |
| is_super_admin | boolean | **Super admin flag** |
| role | text | |
| verified_games | ARRAY | |
| theme_settings | jsonb | Custom theme data |
| contributions | jsonb | |
| personal_goals | jsonb | |
| banner_url | text | |
| status | text | 'approved', 'pending', etc. |
| created_at / updated_at / approved_at | timestamptz | |

**Key insight:** `profiles` now has a `status` column. Row with `status = 'approved'` means the profile is live.

### `pending_profiles` (awaiting approval)
| Column | Type |
|-|-|
| id | uuid |
| user_id | uuid |
| requested_runner_id | text |
| display_name | text |
| has_profile | boolean |
| status | enum (pending/approved/rejected) |
| submitted_at / reviewed_at | timestamptz |

**Note:** `user_id` has a UNIQUE constraint (`pending_profiles_user_id_key`). This is required for the `.upsert({ onConflict: 'user_id' })` pattern used in profile/create and profile/setup.

### `pending_runs` (submitted runs awaiting review)
Notable columns added Feb 28, 2026:
- `claimed_by` (uuid, FK to auth.users) — which verifier claimed the run
- `claimed_at` (timestamptz) — when they claimed it

The permissive INSERT policy (`pending_runs_insert`) was **dropped** Feb 28 — all run submissions now go through the Worker, which validates and inserts via service key.

### `runners` — DROPPED (Mar 2026)
The legacy `runners` table has been dropped from Supabase. All runner data now comes from the `profiles` table. The server-side function `getRunners()` (in `src/lib/server/supabase.ts`) queries `profiles` where `status = 'approved'` and maps rows to the `Runner` TypeScript interface via `profileToRunner()`. The `Runner` type is kept as a domain-level interface — it represents a runner in the UI, not a database table.

### `role_game_verifiers` / `role_game_moderators`
Per-game role assignments. Each row grants a user a role for a specific game.
| Column | Type |
|-|-|
| id | uuid |
| user_id | uuid |
| game_id | text |
| assigned_by | uuid |
| assigned_at | timestamptz |

### Admin/Verifier Detection Pattern
```typescript
// Check profiles for admin
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('is_admin, is_super_admin')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .maybeSingle();

// Check role_game_verifiers for verifier
const { data: verifier } = await supabase
  .from('role_game_verifiers')
  .select('id')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .limit(1)
  .maybeSingle();
```

## 3. Auth Architecture — What Actually Works

### Server Side (reliable)
- `hooks.server.ts` reads httpOnly cookies → creates Supabase server client → sets `locals.session`
- `+layout.server.ts` passes session to client
- Server-side queries via `locals.supabase` always have auth

### Client Side (nuances)
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` creates a `createBrowserClient`
- The `$user` store (from `$stores/auth`) is hydrated from server session data
- **Working pattern for writes:** `admin.ts` uses `supabase.auth.getSession()` to get the access token, then raw `fetch()` with explicit `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header

### Auth Callback (`auth/callback/+server.ts`)
After exchanging the OAuth code for a session, the callback checks if the user has a profile:
1. Queries **`profiles`** (not `runner_profiles` — that was a bug fixed Feb 28)
2. If no profile, checks `pending_profiles` for `has_profile`
3. If neither exists → redirects to `/profile/create`

### Profile State Logic (Header.svelte)
1. Query `profiles` for `runner_id, is_admin, is_super_admin, status` where `user_id = current user`
2. If row with `runner_id` + `status = 'approved'` → **active**
3. If row with `runner_id` but not approved → **pending**
4. If no row → query `pending_profiles` for `has_profile`
5. If `has_profile = true` → **pending**. Otherwise → **none** (needs setup)

### New User Flow
1. User signs in via OAuth (Discord/Twitch)
2. Auth callback checks for existing profile
3. If none → redirects to `/profile/create`
4. Profile create uses `.upsert({ onConflict: 'user_id' })` on `pending_profiles` (not `.update()`)
5. If pre-approved: profile row created immediately
6. If not: waits for admin approval
7. User can skip setup and explore, but can't submit runs without a runner_id

---

## 4. Svelte 5 Conventions

The project uses Svelte 5 runes. Common mistakes to avoid:

| Wrong (Svelte 4) | Right (Svelte 5) |
|-|-|
| `export let prop` | `let { prop } = $props()` |
| `$: derived = x + y` | `let derived = $derived(x + y)` |
| `$: { sideEffect() }` | `$effect(() => { sideEffect() })` |
| `on:click={handler}` | `onclick={handler}` |
| `on:click\|preventDefault` | `onclick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); handler() }}` |
| `<slot />` | `{@render children()}` with `let { children } = $props()` |

**Event modifier syntax doesn't exist in Svelte 5.**

**Variable ordering matters for `svelte-check`:** If a `$derived` references a `$state` variable, the `$state` must be declared first in the file. Even though `$derived` is lazy at runtime, the static analyzer flags it as "used before declaration."

---

## 5. Styling System

### Global SCSS (`src/styles/`)
- CSS custom properties: `--accent`, `--bg`, `--fg`, `--border`, `--panel`, `--surface`, `--muted`
- Radius tokens: `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`
- Tab styles in `_tabs.scss` are global and apply to `.runner-tabs .tab`, `.game-tabs .game-tab`, and `.edit-tabs .edit-tab` — all use a pill/rounded-rect appearance with surface background, border, and rounded top corners. Active tab blends into content below with `border-bottom-color: var(--bg)`.
- Footer grid in `_footer.scss` uses 4-column layout (brand + Explore + Resources + Legal)

### Import Path Aliases
- `$lib` → `src/lib`
- `$stores` → `src/lib/stores`
- `$components` → `src/lib/components`
- `$types` → `src/lib/types`
- `$data` → `src/data`

---

## 6. File Locations

| What | Where |
|-|-|
| Auth store | `src/lib/stores/auth.ts` — exports `session`, `user`, `isLoading` |
| Admin utilities | `src/lib/admin.ts` — `checkAdminRole()`, `fetchPending()`, `adminAction()` |
| Browser Supabase | `src/lib/supabase.ts` |
| Server Supabase | `src/lib/server/supabase.ts` — query helpers |
| TypeScript types | `src/lib/types/index.ts` — all interfaces |
| Utility functions | `src/lib/utils/index.ts` — `isValidVideoUrl()`, `formatDate()`, etc. |
| Header | `src/lib/components/layout/Header.svelte` |
| Footer | `src/lib/components/layout/Footer.svelte` |
| A-Z nav | `src/lib/components/AzNav.svelte` |
| Profile setup | `src/routes/profile/setup/+page.svelte` (lightweight onboarding) |
| Profile create | `src/routes/profile/create/+page.svelte` (full form) |
| Game editor | `src/routes/admin/game-editor/[game_id]/+page.svelte` |
| Run submit | `src/routes/games/[game_id]/submit/+page.svelte` |
| Suggest update | `src/routes/games/[game_id]/suggest/+page.svelte` |
| Game editor list | `src/routes/admin/game-editor/+page.svelte` (freeze-all, AzNav, show limit) |
| CSP headers | `_headers` (Cloudflare Pages custom headers) |
| Worker | `worker/src/index.js` (Cloudflare Worker for admin actions) |

---

## 7. Content Security Policy

CSP is defined in `_headers` at the repo root. Key `connect-src` entries:
- `'self'` — same origin
- `https://*.supabase.co` — Supabase API
- `https://crc-run-submissions.280sauce.workers.dev` — Worker
- `https://challenges.cloudflare.com` — Turnstile
- `https://noembed.com` — Video URL metadata lookup

If a new external API is added, its domain must be added to `connect-src` or client-side fetches will be blocked.

---

## 8. Allowed Video URLs

Defined in `src/lib/utils/index.ts` → `isValidVideoUrl()`:
- YouTube (youtube.com, m.youtube.com, youtu.be)
- Twitch (twitch.tv, m.twitch.tv, player.twitch.tv)
- Bilibili (bilibili.com)

**Nicovideo was removed** per user request. HTTPS only.

---

## 9. Runner Profile Page Structure

The runner profile at `/runners/[runner_id]` has 4 tabs:
- **Overview** (default): About/bio, Highlights, Contributions, Game Credits, In-Progress Goals
- **Run Statistics**: Stats cards, fun stats, game grid with detail drill-down
- **Achievements**: Community achievements, Completed personal goals
- **Activity**: Timeline of recent runs and achievements

Game cards throughout the profile use a zoom-in hover effect on background images.

---

## 10. Fixed Loadout System (Added Feb 28, 2026)

Game categories can define a `fixed_loadout` object that locks certain fields when a runner selects that category on the submit form.

### Schema (stored in game JSONB columns — `full_runs`, `mini_challenges`, `player_made`):
```json
{
  "slug": "trial-of-moon",
  "label": "Trial of Moon",
  "fixed_loadout": {
    "enabled": true,
    "character": "moonstone-axe-charon",
    "challenge": "hitless",
    "restriction": null
  }
}
```

### How it works:
- **Game editor:** Each category item (full runs, mini-challenge children, player-made) has a "Fixed Loadout" toggle. When enabled, dropdowns appear for Character, Challenge, and Restriction — populated from the game's data.
- **Submit form:** When a runner selects a fixed-loadout category, locked fields auto-fill and become disabled with 🔒 indicators.
- **No DB migration needed** — uses existing JSONB columns.
- **TypeScript:** `FixedLoadout` interface in `src/lib/types/index.ts`, added to `FullRunCategory`, `MiniChallengeChild`, `MiniChallengeGroup`, and `PlayerMadeChallenge`.

### Replaces:
The old `fixed_character` boolean on mini-challenge children. The new system is more flexible (can lock any combination of character, challenge, restriction).

## 12. Working With the User — Methodology & Communication

This section is for AI assistants picking up this project. It documents what works well.

### How to Approach Tasks

**1. Read before you write.** Before editing any file, read the actual current content. Don't assume you know what's there from a previous session. Files change between sessions.

**2. Read all relevant files upfront.** When a task touches multiple files, read them all at the start — don't interleave reading and editing. This prevents partial understanding leading to inconsistencies. For a typical multi-file task, expect to read 5-10 files before writing anything.

**3. Understand the blast radius.** Before making a change, trace where the affected code is used. A CSS class rename in `_tabs.scss` affects every file that uses those classes. Grep first, then plan.

**4. Make targeted surgical edits.** The user prefers small, precise changes over sweeping refactors. If the task is "change Representing to Ally of," change exactly that text in the 2-3 files where it appears. Don't refactor the surrounding code.

**5. Verify after editing.** After making string replacements, read back the edited area to confirm the change landed correctly and didn't break nesting. The Cloudflare build will reject malformed Svelte templates (mismatched `{#if}`/`{/if}`, unclosed `<div>`, etc.)

### How to Deliver Files

**Always mirror the repo structure.** Output files at their exact repo paths. The user drags files directly into the repo — if the path is wrong, the file ends up in the wrong place.

**Always include a destination table.** Every response that delivers files must end with a table mapping output files to their repo paths:

| Output file | Repo destination |
|-|-|
| `src/routes/+layout.svelte` | `src/routes/+layout.svelte` |
| `src/styles/components/_tabs.scss` | `src/styles/components/_tabs.scss` |

**Provide complete files, not patches.** The user replaces entire files. Don't give partial snippets that require manual merging.

**NEW files need explicit callouts.** If you're creating a brand-new route (like `/games/[game_id]/suggest/+page.svelte`), make it very clear this is a new file that needs a new directory.

### Communication Style

**Be direct.** Don't narrate your thought process ("Let me think about this..." / "I'll now read the file..."). Just do the work and present results.

**Be concise.** Simple changes need one sentence. Complex architectural decisions deserve explanation. Scale explanation to complexity.

**Ask before guessing.** Database schemas, column names, API shapes — always ask. The user will happily run a SQL query. Guessing causes failed deploys.

**Own mistakes.** If something breaks, say what went wrong, why, and how to fix it. Don't hedge or minimize.

**Changelog-style summaries.** When presenting results, list each file with a short description of what changed. Group related changes. Example:

> **Tab redesign** — `_tabs.scss`: Tabs now use rounded-rect style instead of flat underlines. Active tab blends into content below.
>
> **Runner page** — `[runner_id]/+page.svelte`: "Representing" → "Ally of"

**Don't echo file contents.** The user can see the files. Don't quote back code you just wrote unless explaining a specific decision.

**Don't over-format.** Prose over bullet points for short explanations. Use bullet points only for multi-item lists.

### Common Gotchas

1. **Svelte template nesting:** Every `{#if}` needs `{/if}`, every `<div>` needs `</div>`. When removing a section that contains wrapper elements, count the opening and closing tags. This has caused build failures.

2. **Scoped vs global styles:** Styles in `<style>` blocks are scoped to the component. If you switch a component from local `.tabs`/`.tab` classes to global `.game-tabs`/`.game-tab`, you must remove the conflicting local styles or they'll override the globals.

3. **String replacement precision:** The `str_replace` tool requires exact matches including whitespace. Use `cat -A` to check tabs vs spaces if a replacement fails. Alternatively, use `sed` for tricky replacements.

4. **Cloudflare adapter:** No `node:fs` or `node:path`. No `process.env` (use `$env/static/public` or `$env/static/private`). Build failures from these are hard to debug because the error messages are vague.

5. **The `game_name_aliases` field:** Game search should check aliases too. It's an array on the `games` table. The AzNav + search pattern used on `/games` is the reference implementation — reuse it when adding search elsewhere (like game-editor list).

## 13. Architecture Decisions Log

Decisions made during development that future assistants should know about:

| Decision | Why | Date |
|-|-|-|
| Cookies over localStorage for auth | Cloudflare Workers can't access localStorage; httpOnly cookies work server-side | Feb 2026 |
| JSONB for socials/theme/loadout | Flexible schema, no migrations needed for adding fields | Feb 2026 |
| Suggest Update as separate tab route | Keeps overview page focused; form logic is complex enough to warrant isolation | Mar 2026 |
| Global freeze instead of per-game | Per-game freeze on list page was noisy; global freeze is the emergency use case | Mar 2026 |
| Pill-style tabs over underline tabs | User wanted "distinguishable distance between tabs" — pill shape provides visual separation | Mar 2026 |
| `$derived` over `$effect` for data | Derived values are declarative and don't cause extra re-renders; effects are for side-effects only | Feb 2026 |
| Moderator access to game editor | Per-game moderators can edit content (categories, rules, challenges) but not meta (name, status). RLS policy on `games` table gates writes. | Mar 2026 |
| Profiles RLS column restriction | Users can only update safe profile fields via RLS. Admin flags (`is_admin`, `is_super_admin`, `role`, `status`) blocked at the database level. | Mar 2026 |
| Game editor save rate limit | 3-second cooldown between saves + admin-only field stripping in `saveSection()` as defense in depth. | Mar 2026 |
| Supabase client over raw fetch | Migrated `admin.ts` and `+layout.svelte` from manual REST calls to Supabase JS client for consistency and better error handling. | Mar 2026 |
| KV-backed rate limiting | In-memory `Map` was per-isolate (reset on cold starts, not shared across edge locations). Moved to Cloudflare KV for global persistence. In-memory kept as fallback. Eventual consistency (~60s) is acceptable for rate limiting. | Mar 2026 |
| `additional_runners` sanitized early | Field sanitized via `sanitizeArray()` even though multi-runner feature isn't built yet. Prevents unsanitized JSONB from reaching the database. Will validate against runner IDs when the feature is implemented. | Mar 2026 |

---

## 14. Accessibility (a11y) Build Warnings

`svelte-check` reports ~142 a11y warnings. **These are non-blocking and should be ignored during development.** They will be addressed in a dedicated accessibility pass tracked in `REMINDERS.md`.

When encountering these warnings, the assistant should:
1. **Not treat them as errors** — they don't fail the build
2. **Briefly explain what they mean** if the user asks
3. **Not attempt to fix them** unless the user specifically requests accessibility work
4. **Not add `svelte-ignore` comments** to suppress them — we want them visible for the accessibility pass

The three warning categories:
- **`a11y_label_has_associated_control`** (~100+): Form `<label>` elements not linked to inputs via `for`/`id`. Affects screen readers only.
- **`a11y_click_events_have_key_events`** (~15): Modal backdrop `<div onclick>` without keyboard equivalents. Affects keyboard-only users.
- **`css_unused_selector`** (~10): Dead CSS that can be cleaned up. Tracked in REMINDERS.md under "Content & Polish."
