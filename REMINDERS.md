## Revisit (Needs Polish)
### Global
- [ ] Icons for Verifiers, Moderators, Admins, and Super Admins — attach to profiles
- [ ] Add default profile picture and default banner
- [ ] **Favicon** — update once we have a logo (currently empty placeholder)

### Ideas:
- Submit Page (https://www.challengerun.net/submit):
  - [ ] Can we transform this to populate the respective game? or is that too much work?
- Runner Page:
  - Run Statistics:
    - [ ] Update how the runs are displayed when you click into a game.

8. Unused CSS from accordion-to-tabs conversion in submit-game
The submit-game page still has a few CSS rules from the old accordion pattern that survived cleanup. They won't cause bugs but show up as build warnings. You already saw these in the GitHub Actions logs.
9. Worker is a single 2,477-line file
worker/src/index.js handles all endpoints in one file. This works but makes it harder to maintain. At some point, consider splitting into separate handler files (e.g., handlers/runs.js, handlers/games.js, handlers/profiles.js). Not urgent — the file is well-organized with clear section headers.
10. Some admin pages lack granular role checks
The admin layout guard correctly blocks non-staff users server-side. But within the admin area, most pages only check role?.admin client-side. A game verifier who can access /admin could technically view (but not act on) pages like /admin/financials, /admin/users, or /admin/news since the data queries themselves don't restrict by role. The data is read-only in those cases and the action buttons check roles, so the risk is information exposure to staff members, not unauthorized actions.
11. No rate limiting on client-side Supabase queries
The admin pages make direct Supabase queries (via the anon key + RLS). There's no client-side debouncing on things like search inputs or filter changes. At current scale this is fine, but as the user base grows, adding debounce to search inputs (especially on the runs page with 500-row queries) would be good practice.

## Short-Term Priorities
### 1 Small fixes
- News Section:
  - [ ] Add system patch notes as first 3 news pieces.

### 2. Content & Polish
- [ ] Fill glossary definitions (hit, damage, death, hitless vs damageless, etc.)
- [ ] Fill support page (FAQ, staff section, privacy request form)
- [ ] Test Discord webhooks (run submission, game submission)

### 3. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Review Terms of Service line-by-line
- [ ] Review Privacy Policy line-by-line
- [ ] Make email accounts for privacy and legal contacts
- [ ] Test user data export feature (GDPR compliance)
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan document
- [ ] DMCA safe harbor policy + designated agent registration ($6)
- [ ] Review https://www.gdpradvisor.co.uk/gdpr-countries

---

## Medium-Term Priorities
### 4. Spanish Language Support
**PROMISED TO COMMUNITY — HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] Evaluate: `paraglide-js` or `$lib/i18n` approach
- [ ] Create translation files
- [ ] Add language toggle to header
- [ ] Request community translation help early

### 5. Notifications & Messaging System
**Tier 1 — Notifications (build first):**
- [ ] `notifications` table in Supabase (id, user_id, type, title, message, link, metadata, read, created_at)
- [ ] Bell icon in site header with unread count badge
- [ ] Dropdown or `/notifications` page to view/mark-read
- [ ] Wire into: game review changes, run approvals/rejections, profile approvals, report updates
- [ ] RLS: users can only read/update their own notifications

**Tier 2 — Messaging (build after Tier 1):**
- [ ] `messages` table with conversation threads (sender_id, recipient_id, thread_id, content, read_at)
- [ ] Inbox UI at `/messages` with conversation list + thread view
- [ ] Staff-to-user messaging (for review feedback, moderation)
- [ ] User-to-user messaging (for co-op run verification, team coordination)
- [ ] Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime (optional, nice-to-have)
- [ ] Unread message count in header alongside notification bell

**SQL for notifications table (ready to run):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.notifications (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  type text NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL,
  message text,
  link text,
  metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
  read boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT notifications_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT notifications_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user_unread ON public.notifications (user_id, read) WHERE read = false;
```

### 6. User Report & Request Systems
- [ ] **Report buttons** — "Report" button on runner profiles, game pages, runs (table exists, needs frontend buttons)
- [ ] **User requests** — feature requests, game suggestions, corrections. Could reuse `support_tickets` or a new `user_requests` table.
- [ ] **Content moderation queue** — flag uploaded avatars/banners for review (graphic/sexual content). Consider automated image moderation (Cloudflare Images or similar) when budget allows.

### 6. Verifier CMS
- [ ] Inline editing on game pages with diff preview
- [ ] Require 2 verifiers to approve rule changes
- [ ] Game submission UI in admin dashboard (replace external form)

### 7. Badges & Achievements System
- [ ] Design badge types (run count, challenge completion, community milestones)
- [ ] Run count badges on game cards
- [ ] Badge display on runner profiles
- [ ] Achievement progress tracking

### 8. Leaderboards
- [ ] Per-game leaderboards
- [ ] Per-challenge leaderboards
- [ ] Sortable/filterable tables

### 9. Multi-Runner Support
Requires messaging system to be built first (runners must verify co-op participation).
- [ ] Runner search component (typeahead, searches `profiles` table)
- [ ] `co_runners` column on `pending_runs` (JSONB array of user_ids)
- [ ] Verification flow: co-runner receives a message and must confirm
- [ ] Co-runners displayed on approved run cards
- [ ] Submit form: "Add Additional Runners" section (currently stubbed as Coming Soon)

### 10. Multi-Run Support
For runs that span multiple games (e.g., marathon challenge runs).
- [ ] Scope and design TBD — related to Multi-Game Run Support in Future Features

---

## Future Features (Backlog)
### Modded Game Support
- [ ] Separate game pages for modded versions (Option A from earlier discussion)

### History Tab
- [ ] **UI is built, needs backend wiring** — icons/labels defined for `run_approved`, `rule_updated`, `gm_added`, etc. Server returns empty array. Blocked on: `game_history` table + audit event writes in Worker approval/edit handlers.
- [ ] Rule changes, discussions, community milestones
- [ ] News + history integration (unified timeline)

### Forum Integration
Decision needed: GitHub Discussions vs Discord vs embedded mini-forum
- [ ] `/games/[game_id]/forum` route placeholder exists
- [ ] Option C: Discord integration with widgets + channel links per game

### Multi-Game Run Support
- [ ] `is_multi_game` + `related_games` fields
- [ ] "🎮 MULTI-GAME" badge on game cards
- [ ] Treat like modded games — own game entry with linking relationship

### Community Features
- [ ] Player-made challenges via forum, connected to profiles
- [ ] RSS feed optimization
- [ ] "How to Navigate the Site" guide / FAQ
- [ ] "Fixing Mistakes" guide for admins/verifiers

### Server-Side Pagination
- [ ] Cursor-based pagination for runs queries
    - only needed once a category has hundreds+ runs

### Team Profiles (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Team submission process
- [ ] Team page layout with member lists
- [ ] Team badges

---

## Technical Debt
### Supabase
- [ ] Upgrade to paid plan (first service upgrade)
  - After upgrade: enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords" in Auth → Attack Protection
- [ ] GDPR export gap: `runs` and `game_achievements` RLS filters by `status = 'approved'` — admin can't export non-approved entries (minor, since tables only contain approved rows in practice)

### Security
- [ ] **Cloudflare WAF rate limiting** — Free plan only allows 1 rate limiting rule (currently protecting `/submit` endpoints). Worker now uses KV-backed global rate limiting (upgraded from per-isolate in-memory `Map`). Upgrade to Pro ($20/mo) for full WAF with multiple rules when budget allows.
- [ ] **CSP `unsafe-inline` for scripts** — SvelteKit requires inline scripts for hydration. Cloudflare Pages (static adapter) can't generate per-request nonces. **Accepted risk** — mitigated by input sanitization, RLS, and Worker validation. Revisit if moving to SSR or if SvelteKit adds static nonce support.

## Accessibility

> **Build warnings:** As of Mar 2026, `svelte-check` reports ~142 a11y warnings. These are non-blocking and will be resolved when we tackle this section. See CRC-HANDOFF.md §14 for guidance.

### Color & Theming
- [ ] Light mode CSS variables — audit all `--bg`, `--fg`, `--accent`, `--surface`, `--panel`, `--border`, `--muted` for WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI)
- [ ] Dark/light mode testing across all pages (check for invisible text, low-contrast borders, unreadable links)
- [ ] Colorblind mode testing — verify with Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia simulations (browser DevTools or tools like Stark)
- [ ] Don't rely on color alone to convey status (e.g., approved/rejected/pending should also use icons or text labels)

### Keyboard & Focus
- [ ] All interactive elements focusable and operable via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Visible focus indicators on buttons, links, tabs, dropdowns, and form fields
- [ ] Logical tab order across all pages (especially admin forms and multi-tab layouts)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link at the top of the page
- [ ] Modal backdrops: add `role="button" tabindex="0" onkeydown` handlers (~15 instances across admin modals — financials, games, profiles, runs)
- [ ] Replace `href="#"` on cookie/privacy settings links with `<button>` or `javascript:void(0)`

### Screen Readers & Semantics
- [ ] Semantic HTML throughout — proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
- [ ] `alt` text on all images (game covers, avatars, badges)
- [ ] ARIA labels on icon-only buttons (theme toggle, search, close/dismiss)
- [ ] ARIA live regions for dynamic content (toast notifications, form validation errors)
- [ ] Form `<label>` elements linked to controls via `for`/`id` pairs (~100+ instances: game editor, admin filters, profile edit/create, theme page, rules builder, financials, runs filters, suggest page). Pattern: `<label for="field-id">` + `<input id="field-id">`

### Motion & Preferences
- [ ] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — disable hover zoom effects, transitions, and animations
- [ ] Respect `prefers-color-scheme` — auto-detect dark/light preference on first visit
- [ ] Respect `prefers-contrast` — consider a high-contrast mode

### Content
- [ ] Text is resizable to 200% without layout breaking
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44×44px on mobile
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive (not just "invalid input")

## Notes
### Supabase Upgrade Priority
Supabase is the first service to upgrade. After upgrading:
- Enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords" in Auth → Attack Protection

### Database Schema Rule
**Never guess database schemas, API shapes, or column names.** Always ask for actual schema/data before writing queries. Guessing causes repeated broken deploys.
