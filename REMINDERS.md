This document consolidates all reminders, future ideas, and planned features for CRC.
Cross-reference with `CLAUDE.md` Development Checklist for technical implementation details.

## Revisit (Needs Polish)
### Global
- [ ] Icons for Admins, Super Admins, Verifiers — attach to profiles
- [ ] Add default profile picture and default banner
- [ ] **Favicon** — update once we have a logo (currently empty placeholder)

---

## QA Feedback (Aves — 2/27/2026)
### Still To Do — UX Polish
- [ ] **News container on homepage** — only shows News/Date/Title headers with no content visible. May need posts or a different empty state.

### Still To Do — Suggestions (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Add "Home" button in nav** — Aves recommends alongside logo
- [ ] **Nav layout rebalance** — Aves suggests tabs on left next to logo, search on right

---

## Short-Term Priorities

### 1. Small fixes
- Admin Dashboard:
  - [ ] Swap positioning of: 
    - Profiles with Games 
    - Runs with Game Updates
    - (left-column = game-related ; right-column = user related)
    - Update headers to reflect this
    - rename to something else since Admin is a role
- Games Page:
  - Overview tab:
    - [ ] remove Suggest Updates from Overview tab
    - [ ] Platforms are using slugs instead of Display Name
    - [ ] Genres are using slugs instead of Display Name
  - Runs tab:
    - [ ] Better organize categories
    - [ ] Allow descriptions for mini-challenges
  - Rules tab:
    - [ ] Better styling for "Exceptions"
    - [ ] Add option to export the results
    - [ ] Accordion drop-down for all rules below
  - Submit Run:
    - [ ] Containers max width is much smaller than max width of other sections. consider increasing it for consistency
- Runners Page:
  - [ ] Update variables that show for runners on https://www.challengerun.net/runners page.
- Submit PAge (https://www.challengerun.net/submit)
  - [ ] Extremely Small initial box. Increase max width just for consistency with other pages.
  - [ ] Text in drop-down overlaps with "Or go to a game's page and click "Submit Run" from there."text.
- Profile Edit Page:
  - Customize:
    - [ ] Opacity should say either Banner Opactiy or have Opacity as a sort-of header above the two.
    - [ ] Container needs to say either Container Opacity or have Opacity as a sort-of header above the two.
    - [ ] Container opacity needs to also change the opacity of class pv-left.
      - This is the box immediately outside of the user info.
- Profile/Settings
  - [ ] User needs to have the option to show linked accounts
  - [ ] Add option to remove one of the linked accounts

### 2. Content & Polish
- [ ] Fill glossary definitions (hit, damage, death, hitless vs damageless, etc.)
- [ ] Fill support page (FAQ, staff section, privacy request form)
- [ ] Test Discord webhooks (run submission, game submission)
- [ ] Audit SCSS for dead code

### 3. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Review Terms of Service line-by-line
- [ ] Review Privacy Policy line-by-line
- [ ] Make email accounts for privacy and legal contacts
- [ ] Test user data export feature (GDPR compliance)
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan document
- [ ] DMCA safe harbor policy + designated agent registration ($6)
- [ ] Review https://www.gdpradvisor.co.uk/gdpr-countries

## Medium-Term Priorities
### 4. Spanish Language Support
**PROMISED TO COMMUNITY — HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] Evaluate: `paraglide-js` or `$lib/i18n` approach
- [ ] Create translation files
- [ ] Add language toggle to header
- [ ] Request community translation help early

### 5. Verifier CMS
- [ ] Inline editing on game pages with diff preview
- [ ] Require 2 verifiers to approve rule changes
- [ ] Game submission UI in admin dashboard (replace external form)

### 6. Badges & Achievements System
- [ ] Design badge types (run count, challenge completion, community milestones)
- [ ] Run count badges on game cards
- [ ] Badge display on runner profiles
- [ ] Achievement progress tracking

### 7. Leaderboards
- [ ] Per-game leaderboards
- [ ] Per-challenge leaderboards
- [ ] Sortable/filterable tables

---

## Future Features (Backlog)
### Modded Game Support
- [ ] Separate game pages for modded versions (Option A from earlier discussion)

### History Tab
- [ ] Rule changes, discussions, community milestones
- [ ] Needs Badges/Achievements system first
- [ ] News + history integration (unified timeline)

### Forum Integration
Decision needed: GitHub Discussions vs Discord vs embedded mini-forum
- [ ] `/games/[game_id]/forum` route placeholder exists
- [ ] Option C: Discord integration with widgets + channel links per game

### Multi-Game Run Support
- [ ] `is_multi_game` + `related_games` fields
- [ ] "🎮 MULTI-GAME" badge on game cards
- [ ] Treat like modded games — own game entry with linking relationship

### Community Features
- [ ] Player-made challenges via forum, connected to profiles
- [ ] RSS feed optimization
- [ ] "How to Navigate the Site" guide / FAQ
- [ ] "Fixing Mistakes" guide for admins/verifiers

### Server-Side Pagination
- [ ] Cursor-based pagination for runs queries
    - only needed once a category has hundreds+ runs

### Team Profiles (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Team submission process
- [ ] Team page layout with member lists
- [ ] Team badges

---

## Technical Debt
### Supabase
- [ ] Upgrade to paid plan (first service upgrade)
  - After upgrade: enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords" in Auth → Attack Protection
- [ ] GDPR export gap: `runs` and `game_achievements` RLS filters by `status = 'approved'` — admin can't export non-approved entries (minor, since tables only contain approved rows in practice)

---

## Accessibility
### Color & Theming
- [ ] Light mode CSS variables — audit all `--bg`, `--fg`, `--accent`, `--surface`, `--panel`, `--border`, `--muted` for WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI)
- [ ] Dark/light mode testing across all pages (check for invisible text, low-contrast borders, unreadable links)
- [ ] Colorblind mode testing — verify with Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia simulations (browser DevTools or tools like Stark)
- [ ] Don't rely on color alone to convey status (e.g., approved/rejected/pending should also use icons or text labels)

### Keyboard & Focus
- [ ] All interactive elements focusable and operable via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Visible focus indicators on buttons, links, tabs, dropdowns, and form fields
- [ ] Logical tab order across all pages (especially admin forms and multi-tab layouts)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link at the top of the page

### Screen Readers & Semantics
- [ ] Semantic HTML throughout — proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
- [ ] `alt` text on all images (game covers, avatars, badges)
- [ ] ARIA labels on icon-only buttons (theme toggle, search, close/dismiss)
- [ ] ARIA live regions for dynamic content (toast notifications, form validation errors)
- [ ] Form fields have associated `<label>` elements (not just placeholder text)

### Motion & Preferences
- [ ] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — disable hover zoom effects, transitions, and animations
- [ ] Respect `prefers-color-scheme` — auto-detect dark/light preference on first visit
- [ ] Respect `prefers-contrast` — consider a high-contrast mode

### Content
- [ ] Text is resizable to 200% without layout breaking
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44×44px on mobile
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive (not just "invalid input")

## Notes
### Supabase Upgrade Priority
Supabase is the first service to upgrade. After upgrading:
- Enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords" in Auth → Attack Protection

### Database Schema Rule
**Never guess database schemas, API shapes, or column names.** Always ask for actual schema/data before writing queries. Guessing causes repeated broken deploys.
